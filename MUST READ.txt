Hey Guys ! Welcome to the DUNGEONS&DEMONS, this is a small RPG game developed for entertainment.

# Rules for Implementing the code: If you guys want to go to the direction available, then you have to 
follow the syntax of (“go [Direction]”)

# Rules For Examining the place: You guys should examine each and every place to find useful stuff and info. 
You just have to write (“examine”) and this will show you the items available at that moment.

# Rules for Picking Up an Item: To pick a certain object available after examining the place, 
you should use the syntax of (“get[Item name]”)

# There is a special Command in the last level [attack], just simply write attack to implement it and 
kill the demon.
# If you loose the game due to not having a particular weapon or item, then you have not examined and 
collected each and every place.


NOTE: YOU SHOULD EXAMINE EACH AND EVERY TIME YOU LAND INTO A NEW PLACE.

      “Right Decisions will take you to victory. . . ”
